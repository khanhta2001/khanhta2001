# Hello There! 

- Hi y'all, I'm Khanh! I'm a junior majoring Computer Science at Illinois Wesleyan University!
- My work focuses mostly on back end side with <b>C#</b> and <b>.NET</b> stack, but I also enjoy working with <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b> on various things. 
- Since I started coding, I use <b>GitHub</b> to store projects, both from classes and personal. A bunch of repos on here are mostly ideas and projects I'm currently doing. I just love coding everyday so most of the time I just play with new things I find on internet.
- I started working for RLI Corp as a software engineer intern since May 2022 and discovered about API framework and web development. Since then, I have been playing and working on API project with <b>.NET</b> to create my own <b>Portfolio</b>!
- I'm currently learning about microcontrollers, Linux Kernel development, and FPGA. My goal is to become an embedded Software Engineer!
