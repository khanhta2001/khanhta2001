# Hello There! 

- Hi y'all, I'm Khanh! I'm a junior majoring Computer Science at Illinois Wesleyan University!
- My work focuses mostly on back end side with <b>C#</b> and <b>.NET</b> stack, but I also enjoy working with <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b> on various things. 
- Since I started coding, I use <b>GitHub</b> to store projects, both from classes and personal. A bunch of repos on here are mostly ideas and projects I'm currently doing. I just love coding everyday so most of the time I just play with new things I find on internet.
- I'm proficient in <b>.NET</b> as a back-end development, when I worked as a software engineer intern at RLI Corp. I'm currently learning about <b>PHP</b> for my internship as a Security App Developer at Country Financial.
- I'm currently learning about microcontrollers, Linux Kernel development, and FPGA. My goal is to become an embedded Engineer! This is due to my interest in embedded hardware, taken after my first internship as a robotic development researcher at North Dakota State University!
