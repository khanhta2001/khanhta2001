# Hello There! 
- Hi yall, I'm @Khanhta2001, but you can call me Khanh! I'm a junior majoring Computer Science at Illinois Wesleyan University!
- My work focuses mostly on back end side with <b>C#</b> and <b>.NET</b> stack, but I also enjoy working with <b>Python</b>,<b>Java</b>,<b>C++</b> on various things. 
- Since I started coding, I use <b>GitHub</b> to store projects, both from classes and personal. A bunch of repos on here are mostly ideas and projects I'm currently doing. I just love coding everyday so most of the time I just play with new things I find on internet.
- I started working for RLI Corp as a software engineer intern since May 2022 and discovered about API framework and web development. Since then, I have been playing and working on API project with <b>.NET</b> to create my own <b>Portfolio</b>! 
    (Hopefully I will finish this by end of this year!ðŸ˜Š)
